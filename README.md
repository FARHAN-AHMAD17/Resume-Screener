2. Unzip both the folders.
3. Open anaconda navigator and load jupytor notebook.
4. upload the data.csv , modal.ipynb and , code.ipynb in a specific folder their.
5. after that open the code.ipynb file and first copy the path of the dataset present in your computer and paste the path in the read csv function.
6. After that copy the path of Categorised pdfs folder path and paste it in the directoryvariable where it requires path in the same code.
7. After that the sam path of the categorized pdfs will be pasted in the code.ipynb code where it requires path for the parent folder.
8. Now after setting the paths, first run modal.ipynb code.
9. it will generate joblib.pipeline file in the folder containing those code and modal.ipynb files are present.
10. Now at the end, run the code.ipynb code file and it will execute.
